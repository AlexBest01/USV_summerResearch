The Data prep scripts are what was used to preprocess the data into a format acceptable by wav2vec2

The data within the fairseq folder contains output logs and config files that are in the directory structure that matches the fairseq repo

  - The initialisation script is the shell command used to run the original wav2vec algorithm on the machines at VUW

  - Lastly the test_embedding_extractor.py uses functions from the fairseq repo to evaluate the model.
